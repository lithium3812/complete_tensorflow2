## Assignments and projects in Deep Learning Udemy course.

These files are assignments and projects I worked on in a Udemy Deep Learning course "Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp" by Jose Portilla.

I did not include other notebooks used for demonstration by the instructor.

The course covered most of the popular machine learning algorithms. The folder name indicates the focus of the project inside, or the adopted algorithm.
