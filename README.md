## Assignments and projects in Deep Learning Udemy course

These files are assignments and projects I worked on in a Udemy Deep Learning course "Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp" by Jose Portilla: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/

I did not include other notebooks used for demonstration by the instructor.

The folder name indicates the focus of the project inside, or the adopted neural network model. Data used for each project is stored in the foulder "DATA".

### Contents
- Ordinary Artificial Neural Network
- Convolutional Nrural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network
- Autoencoders
- Generative Adversarial Networks
- Application to Natural Language Processing
- Deployment of NNs on web

### Projects
- Build a neural network model to predict which customers have high risk of default, learning from a loan data with customers' features.
- Image classification project by CNN using the fashion MNIST data.
- Time series analysis by RNN to forecast seasonal icecream consumption.
- Implement an autoencoder to find clusters in a dataset where differences in each group are not so apparent. The data is the average consumption of 17 types of food in grams per person per week for every country in the UK. The autoencoder successfully finds out Northern Ireland has peculiarity in its consumption compared to other 3 countries.
- Train a GANs model with MNIST data to generate images of arabic numbers.
- NLP project with RNN. The network mimicks Shakespeare's writing style.
